# Development Log - 2024-05-05

## Project Initialization

- Initialized frontend skeleton using Next.js 15 + shadcn/ui framework
- Completed bun install and server can run in development mode
- Backend integration with Prisma/PostgreSQL pending

## Homepage Section Design and Development Mode

- Homepage sections planned:
  - Banner/Featured zone (dynamic promotion, CTA, carousel slides)
  - Product & business card section
  - Industry solutions section
  - Company profile/data display section
  - News center featured cards
  - Footer
  - Right-side floating action bar
- Header (navigation), Footer, Banner, and other global components will fetch content via API, not hardcoded.
- Apply "modular component + Error Boundary" design principle:
  - Each section is an independent functional unit with its own props structure
  - If any component fails, only that section is affected, the rest of the page remains functional
  - Props and content designed to match future Prisma Schema and API integration
  - Use locally mocked data, switch to real API later
- All development will follow this iterative model and be logged accordingly.
